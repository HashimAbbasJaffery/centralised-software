# Centralised Software – Developer Onboarding Guide

This project is a Laravel 12 application for managing club memberships, family data, financial recovery schedules, receipts, complaints, and reciprocal privileges with partner clubs. The backend delivers both web views (Blade/Tailwind) and a JSON API secured with Sanctum. A minimal Vite/Tailwind asset pipeline powers the front end.

---

## 1. Quick Start

1. **System requirements**
   - PHP 8.2+
   - Composer
   - Node 18+ & npm
   - MySQL or compatible database
   - (Optional) Google service-account JSON for Sheets integration  
     `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH=/absolute/path/to/service-account.json`

2. **Initial setup**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env     # configure DB, mail, Google credentials
   composer install
   npm install
   php artisan key:generate
   php artisan migrate      # or import centralised_software.sql
   ```

3. **Run development stack** (serves app, queue worker, and Vite watcher):
   ```bash
   composer run dev
   ```

4. **Compile assets for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 3. Core Domains & Models

| Model | Purpose | Key Relations |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **Member** | Primary entity holding personal, contact, payment info | `hasMany Spouse`, `hasMany Child`, `belongsTo CardType`, `hasMany Receipt`, `hasMany RecoverySheet`, `hasOne Profession`, `hasOne Introletter` |
| **Spouse / Child** | Dependents of a member | `belongsTo Member`; children optionally `belongsTo CardType` |
| **CardType** | Membership categories (color, fees) | `hasMany Member`, `hasMany Child` |
| **RecoverySheet** | Payment schedule rows | `belongsTo Member` |
| **Receipt / PaymentMethod** | Recorded payments and method metadata | `belongsTo Member`, `belongsTo PaymentMethod` |
| **Club / Duration / Introletter** | Reciprocal-club handling (destination, visit duration) | `Introletter belongsTo Member, Club, Duration` |
| **ComplainType / ComplainQuestion / Complain** | Complaint management | Types → Questions → Complains |
| **User / Permission** | Admin users and ability-based permissions | `User belongsToMany Permission` via `user_permission` pivot |
| **Setting** | Stores Google Drive sheet ID and link |

---

## 4. Request Validation & Resources

- Validation rules reside in **app/Http/Requests** (e.g., `MemberRequest`, `ReceiptRequest`).
- API responses are normalized through **JsonResource** classes under **app/Http/Resources**.

---

## 5. Major Controllers & Endpoints

### Members
- `GET /api/members` – paginated list with filter scope.
- `POST /api/member/create` – create member + profession/spouse/children uploads.
- `PUT /api/member/{id}/update` – update member and dependents.
- `DELETE /api/member/{id}/delete`
- `GET /api/member/{member}/sheet` – download family sheet PDF.
- OTP‑based lookup: `GET /api/single-member/{user_token}/get`

### Recovery & Receipts
- `POST /api/recovery/{member}/create` – store payment schedule.
- `GET /api/recovery/{member}/get` – fetch schedule.
- `POST /api/member/{member}/receipt/create` – generate receipt, PDF, e‑mail.
- `GET /api/receipts/get` – search/paginate receipts.
- Background jobs: `CreateReceipt`, `CalculateFees`, `PrepareRecoveryData`, `GenerateRecoveryPDF`.

### Reciprocal Clubs & Intro Letters
- CRUD endpoints for `club`, `duration`, and `introletter`.
- Introletter creation links a member, destination club, allowed duration, spouse/children.

### Complaints
- `complain-type` endpoints manage categories and question templates.
- `complains` endpoints list and delete submissions.

### Users & Auth
- OTP flow: `/api/otp/{username}/create`, `/api/otp/{username}/check`
- Login & token issuance: `/api/login`
- Token validation: `/api/check-token`
- User CRUD and permission management.

### Misc
- Member patch routes allow single-field updates for member, spouse, or child (file or text).
- Deployment webhook `POST /deploy` performs `git pull` on server.

## 6. Background Jobs & Queue

| Job | Trigger | Summary |
|-----|---------|---------|
| **CreateFamilySheet** | Member created/updated | Generates PDF family sheet and stores under `storage/app/public/members/FamilySheet/` |
| **CreateReceipt** | Receipt created/updated | Renders receipt PDF under `storage/app/recovery/receipts/` |
| **SaveInGoogleDrive** | Member events or explicit call | Exports all members to Google Sheets & shares document |
| **CalculateFees/GenerateRecoveryPDF/PrepareRecoveryData** | Recovery report generation | Computes balances & PDF schedules |
| **ImportingJob** | Manual dispatch (debug/test routes) | Data import (implementation not shown) |

Ensure a queue worker is running (`php artisan queue:listen`).

---

## 7. Services & Utilities

- **ImageService** – central file uploader to `storage/app/public/profile_pictures/`.
- **UniqueCodeService** – generates unique numeric codes (used for `receipt_id`).
- **UserService** – permission checks (currently returns `true`; intended to verify Sanctum ability).
- **Helpers** – text width splitting for card PDFs.

---

## 8. Mail

- **SendOTP** – sends login OTP using `Invoices/Text/otp` Blade view.
- **ReceiptMail** – emails receipt PDF to member.

Configure mail transport in `.env` (`MAIL_MAILER`, `MAIL_HOST`, etc.).

---

## 9. Views & Assets

- Blade templates under `resources/views` cover all UI: member forms, recovery reports, receipt PDFs (`Invoices/*`), complaint forms, etc.
- Tailwind CSS and minimal JS under `resources/css` and `resources/js`.
- Use `npm run build` for production or `composer run dev` for live compilation.

---

## 10. Testing

- Uses Pest (`tests/`) but current coverage is minimal (placeholder tests).  
  Extend with feature tests around API endpoints and model logic.

---

## 11. Deployment Notes

- `DeploymentController` allows `POST /deploy` to run a `git pull`. Secure this route behind server-level auth or remove in production.
- Jobs that interact with Google APIs need the service account file path and network access.

---

## 12. Additional Tips

- A large SQL dump (`centralised_software (3).sql`) is included for reference data.
- The `front-end/windmill-dashboard` directory is currently empty; all UI resides in Blade/Tailwind.
- Review and harden debug routes in `routes/web.php` (e.g., `/testing-url`, `/sheets`) before production use.
- Queue, mail, and Google integrations require appropriate credentials and CRON/worker setup in the deployment environment.

This guide should provide the next developer with a solid understanding of the system’s structure, dependencies, and workflows, enabling smooth continuation of maintenance and feature development.
